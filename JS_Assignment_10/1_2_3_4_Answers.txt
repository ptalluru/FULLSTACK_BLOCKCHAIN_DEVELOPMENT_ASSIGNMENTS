Javascript Assignment 10

1. Are Higher Order functions and Call back functions the same ? If not,
briefly explain about both functions.

Answer :- No, Higher Order functions and Call back functions are not same.

Higher Order Function :- 
The function which takes another function as an argument or returns a function is known as a higher order function.

Call back Function :-
In JavaScript, the way to create a callback function is to pass it as a parameter to another function, 
and then to call it back right after something has happened or some task is completed.



2. Is filter a Higher Order function in Javascript ? If yes, why ?

Answer:- Yes, The filter() function accepts the callback function to filter the out each element based on the condition set in the callback function ;




3. Give an example of a Higher Order function and a call back function
used in the same program.

Answer :- Here , in the below code, filter is the Higher Order Function and anonymous function which accepts alpha as argument is a callback function. 

const alpha = ['a','b','c','d'];
const presentAlpha =students.filter( (alpha) => {
    if(alpha==='c'){
        return alpha
    }
});
console.log(presentAlpha);




4. Carefully check the example below:
a) What will be the output of this program ?
b) Which function is a Higher Order function here ?
    const names= ['John', 'Tina','Kale','Max']
    function useFunction(arr,fn){
        for(let i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
            fn(arr[i]);
        }
    }
    function argFn (name){
        console.log("Hello " + name );
    }
    useFunction(names,argFn);

Answer:- 

a)  Hello John
    Hello Tina
    Hello Kale
    Hello Max

b) useFunction(arr,fn) is the Higher Order Function because it is accepting another function as an argument.
