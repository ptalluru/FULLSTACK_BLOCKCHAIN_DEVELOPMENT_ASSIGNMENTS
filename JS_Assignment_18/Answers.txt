1. What is the difference between a generator and a function?

Answer:-
    In the normal function, control remains with the called function until, but the generator function 
    allows the caller function to control the execution of a called function.



2. What is the syntax of a generator?

Answer:- 
    The function keyword followed by '*' can be made as Generator Function. 
            Syntax :- function* functionName() { }



3. Are function generators iterable in JavaScript?

Answer:- 
    Upon calling Generator functions, returns the Generator object, which holds the entire Generator iterable 
and can be iterated using next() method. Every next() call on the generator executes every line of code until 
it encounters the next yield and suspends its execution temporarily.
        Example :-

            function* test() {
                console.log("a");
                yield "pause1";
                console.log("b");
                yield "pause2";
                console.log("c");
            }

            let test1 = test();
            test1.next(); //Output at this line     a
            test1.next(); //Output at this line     a
                                                    b
            test1.next(); //Output at this line     a 
                                                    b 
                                                    c
