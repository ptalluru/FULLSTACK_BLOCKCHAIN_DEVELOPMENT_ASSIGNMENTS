4. What is the error in the following code?

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <body>
            <p class="text">Hello World!</p>
            <script>
                document.getElementById("text").innerHTML = "Hi JS DOM";
            </script>
        </body>
        </html>

Answer:- In the above code , it is trying to change the innerHTML based on the id attribute 'text' but 
in the given code the mentioned id attribute is not available instead the attribute value 'text' belongs to the class attribute.
