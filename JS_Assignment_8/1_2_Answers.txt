1. Can we put duplicate values in the set object ?

Answer:- Yes, we can put duplicate value in the set . 
         However, that duplicate value into the set will be added into the set only once. Hence the Set is a collection of UNIQUE elements of any type. 




2. Write the syntax for
a) Creating new set object
b) Adding new element to set object
c) Deleting element from set object

Answer:-

a) Using new keyword : 1) let set = new Set();
                       2) let setWithItems = new Set(["a","b"]);

b) Elements can be added into the set object in two ways i.e using add method and one can pass the elements directly while creating Set object.
    Example :- 1) let set = new Set();
                set.add('a');
               2) let set = new Set(["a","b"]);

c) Elements in the set object can be deleted using inbuilt delete function by passing the required element to be deleted into that delete method.
    Example :- let set = new Set(["a","b"]);
               set.delete('b'); // return boolean i.e, if the element deleted returns true or else false .
