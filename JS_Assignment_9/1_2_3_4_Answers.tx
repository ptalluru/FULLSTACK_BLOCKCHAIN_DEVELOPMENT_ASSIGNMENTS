Javascript Assignment 9

1. Carefully observe this example.
a) Is the InnerFunction() a closure?
b) What is output of this program
    function OuterFunction() { 
        var outerVariable = 100;
        function InnerFunction() {
            alert(outerVariable);
        }
    return InnerFunction;
    }
    var innerFunc = OuterFunction();
    innerFunc();

Answer:-
a) Yes, InnerFunction() is a closure.
b) Error (alert is not defined) because in server side rendering browser related functions may not work in server side nodejs environment, so instead we can use console.log(outerVariable) which results 100.



2. What is the difference between a closure and a scope ?

Answer:- 
If we declare any variables in a function, we can only access it in that function. These variables are said to be scoped to the function. 
If we define any inner function within another function , this inner function is called a closure



3. What is a lexical scope and how is it related to closure?

Answer:- 
Lexical scope is the environment that holds the variables of the InnerFunction as well as the OuterFunction.
Closure is an InnerFunction which has access to variables of the OuterFunction which means the closure feature is using the lexical scope concept.



4. Output of following closure ?
    for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        setTimeout(function log() {
            console.log(i); // What is logged?
        }, 1000);
    }

Answer:- 3 will be printed 3 times because setTimeout is a callback function which waits for the for loop to be completed . This can be resolved by using let instaed of var and the output will be 0,1,2 .
